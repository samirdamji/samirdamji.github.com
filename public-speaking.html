      <p>The annual public speaking competition at my school is without doubt the most nerve-racking event of the year; an event that evokes high fear amongst the student body.  I was fortunate to have been able to set my fears aside (and I certainly had them in grade one!) at a young age and accomplish things that I am most proud of to this day.   I am greatly honored to hold Collingwood School’s record for <strong>10 consecutive gold wins</strong> in public speaking – the highest number of gold medals achieved by a student in the school’s history.</p>
      <p>In October last year, I was invited to participate in the <strong>International Independent Schools Public Speaking Competition</strong> at The York School in Toronto.  I found it to be an amazing learning opportunity for me and I was fortunate to place <strong>2nd in the Newscast Radio Category</strong>.
        <p>This year I had the pleasure of taking part in <strong>IISPSC</strong> again, this time in my hometown of Vancouver. I placed <strong>1st in Radio Newscast</strong>, <strong>2nd place Interpretive Read</strong>, <strong>3rd place After Dinner Speech</strong>, <strong>Overall 2nd Best Speaker</strong>, <strong>Top Canadian Speaker</strong>, and <strong>Advanced to World Competition to be held in Australia April 2017.</strong>.
