      <p>I was extremely fortunate to be able to represent both my school and my country at this renowned economics competition. I was able to network with like-minded students from around the world, delve deeper into my passion, and meet my long-time inspiration Professor Gregory Mankiw. My team of four posted the highest score in the written portion of the competition, and qualified as one of the top 16 teams; this is just after learning one year of economics!<p>
