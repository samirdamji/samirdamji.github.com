      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <p>I am who I am because of the opportunities afforded to me at Collingwood School, a world-class university preparatory school in West Vancouver, British Columbia.  As a lifer (K-12), I can assure you that the education I have received at this school has been transformational in making me the person I am today.  The challenging academic curriculum to the vast number of extracurricular opportunities have opened my world view and are responsible for defining and shaping my character.</p>

      <p><strong>I am a Shia Imami Ismaili Muslim</strong><br> A community led by His Highness the Aga Khan, 49th direct descendent of Prophet Mohammed.</p>
      <p><strong>I love basketball!</strong><br>  Ironically, the one sport that consumes my passion is the one that physically challenges me the most.  Being the shortest player on the court amongst giants can be intimidating, but I’ve learnt to overcome adversity and that perseverance is the name of the game,</p>

      <p><strong>I am a public speaker!</strong><br>  I am honored to hold my school’s record for 10 consecutive years of gold wins in our annual Public Speaking Competition.</p>
