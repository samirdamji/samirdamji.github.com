      <h3>SHAD Valley</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2015, I had the privilege of attending SHAD Valley hosted at Carleton University in Ottawa.  The SHAD program empowers exceptional high school students – at a pivotal point in their education- to recognize their own capabilities and envision their extraordinary potential as tomorrow’s leaders and change makers.</p><br>
        <p><strong>SHAD was indeed a life altering experience for me.</strong>  During the month long program which is STEM (science, technology, engineering & math) focused, I was elected the CEO of my group’s startup company and we were challenged to create an innovative product that would help Canadians play outdoors.  We won the competition at Carleton and as team leader, I was invited to present our product a few months later at Shad’s National Competition in Waterloo, Ontario.    I was invited to speak at the awards ceremony, where we placed <strong>3rd for Best Website Design</strong> and <strong>2nd for Best Marketing.</strong></p><br>
