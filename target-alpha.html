      <h3>Target Alpha</h3>
        <!-- <p>The summer I was at SHAD Valley, I discovered an incredibly neat program designed to give Canadian secondary students remarkable opportunities in business, investments and networking.  Moreover, I learnt that this financial literacy program was only available in the eastern provinces and so I decided to champion my efforts in bringing this initiative, Target Alpha to British Columba.</p><br> -->
        <!-- <p>Today, I am proud to be the Vice-President of the BC Chapter and my team and I have managed to engage 13 different high schools across Greater Vancouver to set up their own Target Alpha Teams.</p> -->
        <p>Run by students with a big dream — to spread all across Canada. Benefits include financial education, networking, and leadership experience. There’s a risk this may fall flat on my face… Gow could I say no?</p>
        <p> This was the pitch I received from a fellow SHAD alumnus regarding Target Alpha, an inter-school stock trading program that had been launched in Ontario in 2013. Approached to expand the program to BC, I seized the opportunity. Now, as Vice President of the BC chapter, I’ve had a blast spearheading Target Alpha’s inaugural 2015/2016 year on the West Coast. We managed to engage 17 BC high schools in the program, implementing in each school a club that resembles a professional investment firm. Presenting at conferences, skyping students across Canada, and searching for sponsorships served as a great learning curve. Through Target Alpha, I’ve reinforced the notion that there is no alpha in life without risk.</p>
