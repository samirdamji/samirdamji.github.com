      <h3>Target Alpha</h3>
        <p>Run by students with a big dream — to spread all across Canada. Benefits include financial education, networking, and leadership experience. There’s a risk this may fall flat on my face… How could I say no?</p>
        <p> This was the pitch I received from a fellow SHAD alumnus regarding Target Alpha, an inter-school stock trading program that had been launched in Ontario in 2013. Approached to expand the program to BC, I seized the opportunity. As Vice President of the BC chapter, I had a blast spearheading Target Alpha’s inaugural 2015/2016 year on the West Coast. As <strong>Co-President</strong>, we managed to engage 17 BC high schools in the program, implementing in each school a club that resembles a professional investment firm. Presenting at conferences, skyping students across Canada, and searching for sponsorships served as a great learning curve. <strong>Through Target Alpha, I’ve reinforced the notion that there is no alpha in life without risk.</strong></p>
