      <h3>CCMP 2016</h3>
      <p>‘CCMP’ is an acronym for <strong>Collingwood’s Career Mentorship Program</strong>, a new student-led program that I developed and instituted for my school.  During the summer prior to entering my grade 10 year, it occurred to me that although many senior high school students have an idea as to where their academic interests may lie, most are unsure of what specific careers they may be interested in.  These reflections gave birth to CCMP – a program designed to address this void by allowing students to engage in a <strong>customized mentorship program that links students with a specific mentor of their choice.</strong>  Mentors are professionals in their respective fields with mentorship being the key ingredient in this program.  I pitched this proposal to my school principal as well as to the academic leadership and was thrilled to have them accept my initiative. </p><br>
      <p>As president of the CCMP Club, I now work with a core committee of 11 senior students whose task is to execute and sustain the program over the full academic year.  I am pleased to report that we now have a Mentor Database rich with over 75 mentors consisting of professional parents, alumni and members of our community.</p><br>
      <p>In March of this year, we hosted the inaugural <strong>2016 CCMP CONFERENCE:</strong>  a full scale event catered for over 100 grade 10 students at our school. We were able to bring in 13 mentors and host a round table conference that proved to be a great success.  It is my hope that CCMP will grow in leaps and bounds over the coming years and will leave both a lasting impact on senior students and a legacy for Collingwood School.</p><br>
